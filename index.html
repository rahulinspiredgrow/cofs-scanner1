    <!-- Section 2: Definition of Oil Spills -->
    <div class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-800">2. Definition</h2>
      <p>An oil spill is the unintentional discharge of crude oil or refined petroleum into marine or coastal environments, often during extraction, transport, or storage. Spills create toxic slicks that spread rapidly, contaminating water and habitats. NOAA identifies oil spills as a major marine threat, with toxic compounds causing acute and chronic harm to species. Small spills, though less publicized, occur frequently—3,000 annually in U.S. waters—damaging sensitive ecosystems like wetlands. Effective management requires rapid containment and bioremediation, but only 10-15% of oil is typically recovered, emphasizing the need for prevention over cleanup.</p>
